# 📊 Database & SQL

This repository showcases my learning and hands-on practice with **database fundamentals** and **SQL querying** using **MySQL Workbench**. The work focuses on writing queries to explore, analyse and extract insights from structured data.

## 🌍 SQL Practical – World Database

This project uses the **World database**, a sample dataset containing information about countries, cities and populations. The aim was to practise writing SQL queries to answer real-world style questions using demographic and geographic data.

🔗 *World database SQL file:*
[World Database](https://b2wcompletetraining057-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yusufs_justit_co_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyusufs%5Fjustit%5Fco%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FDesktop%2FBootcamp%20Folder%2FWorkshops%2F8%20Week%20Model%2FWeek%203%20%2D%20SQL%2Fworld%20db%2Fcreate%20world%20db%2Esql)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Writing basic and advanced `SELECT` queries
* Filtering data using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`
* Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
* Removing duplicates using `DISTINCT`
* Using aggregate functions such as `COUNT` and `AVG`
* Working with **subqueries**
* Limiting and ranking results
* Performing **population and demographic analysis**
* Joining multiple tables using `JOIN`

---

## 📌 Example Analysis Scenarios

The SQL queries were written to answer questions such as:

* Counting the number of cities in a specific country (e.g. USA)
* Finding the most and least populated cities
* Identifying countries with the highest life expectancy
* Analysing cities in Europe
* Comparing capital city populations
* Calculating population density
* Ranking cities by population size

## 📸 SQL Workbench Output Examples

Below are screenshots of my work in **MySQL Workbench**, showing the SQL queries and their results.

Each image demonstrates a different type of analysis, including:

* **Filtering and sorting data** to narrow results to specific countries or regions
* **Aggregate calculations** such as total city counts and average life expectancy
* **Population comparisons** between cities and countries
* **JOIN operations** combining data from multiple tables (City, Country, CountryLanguage)
* **Ranking and limiting results** to highlight top or bottom values

These examples show how SQL queries transform raw database tables into meaningful insights that support data analysis and decision-making.
